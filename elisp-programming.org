#+TITLE: Elisp Programming


* Programming exercises from [[https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html][here]]
1. Write a program that prints ‘Hello World’ to the screen.
#+begin_src elisp
(message "Hello, World!")
#+end_src
2. Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.
   I lifted this directly from [[https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/12/learning-a-little-elisp/][here]]
#+begin_src elisp
(message
 (let
     ((question "What's your name?")
      (our-result "Hello, %s!"))
   (format our-result
           (read-string (format "%s " question)))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello, james!

3. Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.
   #+begin_src elisp
(message
 (let ((me "Me!")
       (justAnotherString "another string")
(inputName (read-string "What's your name?"))
                )
(if (or (equal inputName "Alice") (equal inputName "Bob"))
    (message "Welcome %s" inputName)
  (message "Buzz off, %s..." inputName))))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Buzz off, Skip...

   #+begin_src elisp
(if (> 4 5)                               ; if-part
    (message "4 falsely greater than 5!") ; then-part
  (message "4 is not greater than 5!"))   ; else-part
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 4 is not greater than 5!
